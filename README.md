Coffee Shop Retail Business Analysis 

 **Overview**

The Roastery Coffee operates three store locations in New York: Lower Manhattan, Hell's Kitchen, and Astoria. The company offers 80 products across 9 categories. This project analyzes six months of transactional data (Jan–Jun 2023) to understand sales performance, store efficiency, product trends, and forecast revenue.

The top five categories (coffee, tea, bakery, chocolate, beans) contribute about 93% of total revenue

Astoria recorded the most orders but lowest revenue per order, suggesting smaller basket sizes
